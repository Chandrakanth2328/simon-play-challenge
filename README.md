Simon Game Challenge:

Overview:
The Simon Game is a memory game where the player has to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. This project implements the classic Simon game using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**. The goal of the game is to test and improve memory and concentration by challenging the player to remember and replicate patterns in a sequence.

Features:
- Interactive Game: Players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that grow progressively longer.
- Sound Effects: Each color corresponds to a unique sound to help the player remember the pattern.
- Score Tracking: The score increases with each successful round.
- Game Over: The game ends when the player fails to replicate the sequence correctly, and the score resets.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5: Structure of the game interface.
- CSS3: Styling the game elements to create a clean, user-friendly interface.
- JavaScript: Core functionality, including handling game logic, sequences, and events.
- jQuery: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling to simplify JavaScript code.

How to Play:
1. When the game starts, a sequence of colors will be shown in a random order.
2. Each color is associated with a specific sound.
3. The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colors in the correct order.
4. With each round, the sequence becomes longer.
5. If the player clicks the wrong color or order, the game ends, and the score is reset.
